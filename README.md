# Cult of Sid Webpage

As part of CovHack2020 after an eventful game of Werewolf we decided to make a webpage dedicated to the godfigure/tyrant of the game trying
in both the community and domain awards.

The website itself has many features including being hosted on the Google Cloud and using Twillo for a interactive helpline used as contact details
on the webpage.
